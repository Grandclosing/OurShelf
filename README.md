# OurShelf
A social marketplace fighting to empower black communities

---

I'm using [UI Coach](https://uicoach.io/) to help me generate app / website ideas to practice front-end development. This app generates an idea/concept, a color palette, a font pairing, and an illustration library. Here's what I got: 

### Prompt
"Design a social shopping app that will help you find and connect with users to discuss everything related to shopping. Users can exchange information about offers, deals, best products to shop, reviews, etc., to help others make informed shopping decisions."

### Color Palette
![Color 1](/img/color1.jpg) #C7F0DB

![Color 2](/img/color2.jpg) #8BBABB

![Color 3](/img/color3.jpg) #6C7B95

![Color 4](/img/color4.jpg) #464159

### Fonts 
[Cardo](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cardo) & [Josefin Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Josefin+Sans)

### Illustration Library
[Black Illustrations](https://www.blackillustrations.com/)

Given these parameters, I decided it made sense to work on something that was supportive of the black community. So I came up with 'OurShelf' - a social marketplace where people can conncect each-other with businesses that support movements like [Black Lives Matter](https://blacklivesmatter.com/). This app should empower black business owners, businesses that demonstrate cultural, ethnic, and racial diversity in its work force, and businesses operating in predominantly black regions that are supporting those regions. 

I used [GraphicSprings](https://www.graphicsprings.com/) to generate and modify a logo I could work with:
